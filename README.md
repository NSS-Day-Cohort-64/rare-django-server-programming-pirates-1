# Rare Publishing Platform

Welcome to the Rare Publishing Platform! This repository hosts a collaborative group project aimed at creating a comprehensive publishing platform. Here's everything you need to know to get started.

## Primary Features

The Rare Publishing Platform is designed to provide users with a robust publishing experience. Key features of the project include:

- **Client-Side Built with React:** The platform includes a dynamic and interactive client-side application built using React. This frontend application offers views for posts, comments, tags, and categories, enhancing the user experience.

- **CRUD Functionality:** For each of the essential elements—posts, comments, tags, and categories—the platform supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. This ensures that users have complete control over their content.

- **Server-Side Powered by Django:** The server-side of the platform is built using Python and Django. This backend infrastructure handles data processing, storage, and retrieval. It facilitates seamless communication between the frontend and the database.

- **SQLite Database:** The project utilizes a local SQLite database to efficiently manage and store data. This choice offers scalability while keeping the development process streamlined.
